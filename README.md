# Best Markets for Advertising Programming Courses
In this project, we assume that we are working for an e-learning company that focuses on programming courses. Our goal is to provide the marketing team with insight into which countries would have the most appetite for our products. We need to find the two best markets to advertise our product based on the size of the markets and the average amount of money the coders are willing to spend.

The best way to gather relevant data would be to conduct surveys in each market. However, since this would be an expensive and slow process, we decided to explore already available datasets online. In particular, we decided to use the data from [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2018-new-coder-survey). This dataset contains responses from more than 20,000 developers in multiple markets that we are interested in.

## Findings

We find that U.S has the largest representation of new coders in our sample with about 75% after removing the outliers. U.S also has the higest average money spent monthly of about $143. Hence, it is an obvious choice for the best market to advertise in for our courses. For the second best market, the answer is not as apparent.

When looking at the proportion of new coders, India has the second largest market with about 12%. However, Canada has the second highest average monthly spending on learning with about $93. The question becomes whether it would be better to choose India, which has a larger market, or Canada, where people are likely to spend more on learning coding. Considering that our courses costs $59 per month, the average consumer in India would still be able to afford it since it is within their budget of around $66.

Perhaps it is possible to market in all three countries. For example, we can use 75% of our resources in U.S, 12% in India, and 6% in Canada. Nevertheless, there is a risk of spreading ourselves too thin by tapping into all three markets in this manner. Another option is to concentrate our efforts in the two biggest markets, namely U.S and India (70%, 30%, respectively).

The best decision would be to send our results to the marketing team and leave it upto their expertise.
